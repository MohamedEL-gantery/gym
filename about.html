               A health club<br/>(also known as a fitness club, fitness center, health spa,
                and commonly<br/> referred to as a gym) is a place that houses exercise equipment 
                for the<br/> purpose of physical exercise. Alan Smithee describes a health club as
                 a<br/> "company providing people, access to controlled environmental condition<br/> space and services focused on physical fitness and health in exchange of<br/> a fee."<br/><br/>
               In recent years, the number of fitness and health services have increased,<br/> expanding the interest among the population.
               Today, health clubs and<br/> fitness centers are a reference of health services, rising the adherence to<br/> physical activity.
